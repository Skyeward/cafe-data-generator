Cafe Data Generator is a program for generating random sales data for one day of a virtual cafe. It is based on an original version by IW.


There are [or will be] two versions:
 - csv_generator.py will generate a .csv file intended to emulate the original IW cafe data generator as accurately as possible.
 - [coming soon!] will generate a .csv file with new custom settings intended to simplify and remove bugs from the original version.


NOTES FOR BOTH VERSIONS:
 - Random names are generated from an API that is limited to 20,000 name requests per minute. This will limit you to running the program - and thus generating a .csv file - more than ~10 times a minute approximately.
 
 
 
IF USING CSV_GENERATOR:
Some notes to bear in mind if using the version intended to emulate the IW original:
